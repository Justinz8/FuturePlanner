# [Future Course Planner](https://futureplanner.vercel.app/)

## Version 1.0.0

The future course planner is a website that allows students from the University of Toronto Scarborough and the University of Waterloo to plan out their undergraduate career. The website allows students to plan out their courses for the next few years and see what courses they need to take in order to graduate. The website also allows students to see what courses they have taken and what courses they have left to take in order to graduate.

Feel free to fork the repo and send any questions to uoftuwfutureplanner@gmail.com, and any contributions are welcome.
Support for additional universities is not planned at the moment, as it would likely require an API key, but this is not off the table entirely.
